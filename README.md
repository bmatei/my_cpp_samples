# my_cpp_samples
A handful of sample code written by myself in C++ for school projects or competitions
I compiled this list quite quickly from backups without checking all the code thoroughly. Because of this some of the code might be duplicated here and there depending on how, when and why I backed it up.

At this initial commit, most of the code is the basic implementation of data structures in C++, but there are other stuff as well.

ListaCirculara --> CircularList
ListaSimpla --> SimplyLinkedList
ListaSimpluInlantuita --> SimplyLinkedList
Stiva --> Stack
Coada --> Queue
TurnurileDinHanoi --> The Hanoi towers problem
Abori Huffman --> Huffman trees
